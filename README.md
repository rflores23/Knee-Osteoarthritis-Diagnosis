# Knee-Osteoarthritis-Diagnosis

The goal of this project is to create a deep-learning model that will diagnose the presence and severity of radiographic osteoarthritis (KL) from cropped knee xray images. The dataset contains xrays of one or both knees from 752 patients (565 patients in train/val, 187 patients in test) over several timepoints. Each knee xray is evaluated by a radiologist and assigned a KL grade (from 0 to 4) which describes disease severity. The dataset we're working with is approximately 1/6th of the patients in the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset [ https://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/ ].
